<h1>Lauren Godwin, 50</h1>
<h2>Week 10</h2>

<p>I honestly don't get arrays and wasn't entirely sure how to create my own so I went off the example and switched some things up.</p>
<p>I tried putting in more shapes like rectangles and triangles to do the same type of movement but when I made the codes nothing showed up. So I am not sure where I went wrong. I then put my question up on the issues board but no one responded so I deleted those codes and just went with a knock off of the website example. I am still trying to figure out where I went wrong but so far I come up empty handed.</p>
