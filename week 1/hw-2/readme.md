<h2>My First README.md</h2>
<p> `I've been a bit behind in this class due to figuring this all out.<br> I am taking 2 other coding classes that are dealing with the basics and trying to keep everything seperate is hard.` </p>
<p><ul>Some things I don't quite understand:
<li>Git on the terminal</li>
<li>How github desktop and atom can link together</li>
<li>Basically everything to do with coding...</li></ul></p>
<p><ol>The one thing I do understand:<br>
<li>When you code, you use < > at the end of your commands.</li></ol></p>
