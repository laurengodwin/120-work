<p> ["Hello World!" Sketch](https://laurengodwin.github.io/120-work/hw-3/)

<h2>Homework 3 Response</h2>
<p>I have really struggled with this class. I am taking 2 other coding classes and each one is set up differently which makes it hard to separate them.<br> I had to get a friend to help me set up the sketch.js and make it work because it wasn't showing up in my browser. I don't really understand the class repo issue tracker so I haven't used it yet.<br></p>

<p>My sketch.js still doesn't work in the link but I am turning it anyways.</p>
